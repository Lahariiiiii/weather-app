# weather-app
A weather app in Python created using the requests library to fetch data from a weather API like OpenWeatherMap. 

Involves integrating various libraries and APIs to fetch and display real-time weather data. The process begins with selecting a weather API, such as OpenWeatherMap or WeatherAPI, which provides detailed weather information. You need to sign up on the chosen platform to obtain an API key required for making requests.

Using the requests library, you can send HTTP requests to the weather API, which returns weather data in JSON format. For instance, you can retrieve current weather conditions, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and forecasts for a specific location by constructing the appropriate API endpoint.
